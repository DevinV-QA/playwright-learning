# Playwright Python QA Automation

This repository is a learning-focused Playwright automation framework built using **Python**, **Pytest**, and the **Page Object Model (POM)**.  
It demonstrates clean test structure, multi-page flows, and meaningful assertions aligned with real QA practices.

---

## Tech Stack
- Python
- Playwright
- Pytest

---

## Project Structure
- pages/ # Page Object Models (UI interactions & locators)
- tests/ # Test scenarios and assertions
- utils/ # Shared helpers (reserved for future use)

---

## Implemented Pages
- Login Page
- Inventory Page
- Cart Page

Each page encapsulates its own locators and actions to ensure maintainability and scalability.

---

## Covered Scenarios
- Login page load validation
- Valid login flow
- Invalid login error handling
- Inventory page load after login
- Add item to cart (cart badge increments)
- Remove item from cart (cart updates correctly)

---

## Key Concepts Practiced
- Page Object Model (POM)
- Stable locator strategies
- Meaningful assertions
- Multi-page user flows
- Test isolation
- Git & GitHub version control
- Pytest fixtures
- Parametrised tests
- Data-driven testing
- Test Tagging (smoke / regression)

---

## Purpose
This repository exists to:
- Practice professional QA automation patterns
- Demonstrate Playwright + Pytest fundamentals
- Serve as a portfolio reference for QA / Automation interviews
